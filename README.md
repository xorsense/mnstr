# mnstr app

## About

This is an app that scans a qr code and generates a mnstr from the provided assets. You can visit the [mnstr website](https://mnstr.at/) or look at the code [here](https://github.com/xorsense/mnstr_web).

This primarily uses Dart with the Flutter SDK[^1]. The app also uses an [API](https://github.com/xorsense/mnstr_api) which we made using Rust[^2].

Please also make sure to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
